            <p>The Mars Exploration Program studies Mars as a planetary system in order to understand the formation and early evolution of Mars as a planet, the history of geological processes that have shaped Mars through time, the potential for Mars to have hosted life, and the future exploration of Mars by humans. The strategy has evolved as we have learned more about Mars and as more questions have arisen. We have gone from “Follow the Water” to “Explore Habitability” to “Seek Signs of Life.”</p>

            <p>Goal 2:  concerns fundamental questions about how the climate of Mars has evolved over time to reach the current state, the processes that have operated to produce this evolution, and whether the Martian atmosphere and climate reflect features that are universal to planetary atmospheres. This Goal is further divided into three objectives:</p>
            <li>
                <ul>Characterize the state of the present climate of Mars' atmosphere and surrounding plasma environment, and the underlying processes, under the current orbital configuration,</ul>
                <ul>Characterize the history of Mars’ climate in the recent past, and the underlying processes, under different orbital configurations, and Characterize Mars’ ancient climate and underlying processes.</ul>

            <p>Goal 3:  seeks insight into the composition, structure, and history of Mars as a planet, through deeper understanding of its surface and interior. The investigaton of Mars is a compelling scientific exploration in its own right, but the planet also might once have hosted potentially habitable, Earthlike environments.</p>
